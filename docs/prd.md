## What is the problem i am trying to solve?
There are many cli apps that help developers manage their tasks. However in my work, alot of my work 
revolves around user meetings, gathering requirements and breaking down work into bite size pieces.
I find todo apps to lack the ability to store documentation/requirements and context well and have to
resort to google docs to document my work or other task management software outside of the cli. I am
an engineer and i enjoy working in the cli and would like to track my requirements in the cli and with git.

## Who are we building for?
Myself and if anybody else who might be going through the same issue

## What is my success metric?
If i can use this software to manage a project without having to resort to google docs or other task
management software?

## How can i get feedback on my work?
Github

## What is the least i can deliver that can help me achieve my success?
- Create/Update/Delete PRDS in the CLI as Markdown files
- Create/Update/Delete Issues in the CLI as Markdown files
- Create/Remove associations between PRDS and Issues
